Examples include Christian canon law, Islamic sharia, Jewish halakha, and Hindu law. Religious law generally decides on particular issues that are important to religion, for example divorces, cases of adultery, ritual prohbitions, dietary norms, how to handle financial disputes etc. 
In certain countries, there exist courts that decide on particular issues based on religious law. For example in the UK, there exist Sharia councils and Jewish Beth Din courts. In the US, there exists the Judicial Council of the United Methodist church. For these courts to have jurisdiction, both parties in the dispute need to consent to the jurisdiction of the court. These courts can be seen as a form of arbitration.",,,,,

No motive has clearly been established, but what is undisputed, is that thanks to the grind WWE put him through (chair shots to the head, risky head-first dives etc), his brain had advanced CTE (A disease that impairs thinking, and causes behavioral and mood problems- commonly seen among athletes from contact sports like wrestling, boxing, rugby, American football), with some terming it to resemble ""the brain of an 80 year old with Alzheimer's"". By all accounts, Benoit had not demonstrated any such violent tendencies prior to performing the stunts that led to the CTE. Till date, the WWE refuses to acknowledge Chris Benoit for the career he had, denies the records he holds, and cuts out any footage of his matches from their extensive archived footage.

Oil-rich Libya has been in chaos since the Arab spring movement and NATO bombing campaign that toppled Gaddafi in 2011. Attempts to build a democratic state after Gaddafi fell, disintegrated into a new civil war between rival governments in 2014. Since 2014 the fighting has mainly been between rival centres of political power in east and west Libya after election disputes: namely the UN-recognised Tripoli administration, known as the Government of National Accord (GNA) led by Sarraj, and the Tobruk administration in the eastern city, which chose General Haftar to lead the Libyan National Army (LNA). While the GNA is officially recognised by the UN as Libya’s legitimate government, it holds little power on the ground, and some distrust its Islamist politics. Haftar’s supporters say he is a bulwark against extremism, while others see him as another would-be military dictator. 2. Over the last few years foreign powers have increasingly intervened in Libya’s civil war to defend their own strategic and economic interests. The democratically chosen GNA is backed by the UN and many western countries, but its main allies are Turkey, Qatar and Italy. The LNA enjoys the support of Russia, Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, France and Jordan. The recent escalation in fighting comes despite increased international pressure on both sides to return to negotiating a political settlement and to halt the violence over concerns about the spread of coronavirus.

Her presidency included many successful reforms on social welfare in Argentina, but was also marred with corruption (including alleged bribes stolen from the Venezuelan national oil company to fund her campaign, and providing government contracts to former members of her party). This ultimately cost her the 2015 election, where she was replaced by Mauricio Macri. Macri ran on a platform of political and economic reform, and alleviating poverty in Argentina. Under his leadership, inflation rocketed to 56%, and poverty increased from 29% to 35%. While still under investigation for corruption, Kirchner announced that she would run as the VP running mate to Alberto Fernández at the 2019 election, in an attempt to depose Macri.

The AAP wants to reverse the way that the accountability of government operates and has taken an interpretation of the Gandhian concept of swaraj as a tenet. The swaraj model lays stress on self-governance, community building and decentralization of power from the centre (federal government). The Indian National Congress is a centre-left political party who have historical roots in the formation of the Indian state. Under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi, Congress became the principal leader of the Indian independence movement and have historically done well in elections and have been in government.

For example, which character you play in League of Legends or what you choose to spend your resources on in Counter Strike (weapons, armour, items). When one of these choices is disproportionately strong, it creates imbalances in the game. Due to the complexity of these games, even small imbalances can have very large impacts on the way the game must be played, such that a player who is able to exploit these imbalances is often able to easily defeat a player with far more technical skill. “Patches” are updates to video games which typically serve three purposes. 1) To add new features to a game. 2) To remove existing features from the game. 3) To make existing characters or features in the game weaker (“nerfing”) or stronger (“buffing”). Patches in esports are predominantly used to alter the competitive balance. Patches can often radically alter the “meta” (the widely agreed upon optimal strategy for play) in unexpected ways.",,,,,

Despite the dangers of Hyrule, they have succeeded in remaining relatively insulated from war or crisis. This is partially due to the fact that they live in a city (Gerudo Town) in a remote desert and also because they are a society made up largely of highly skilled warriors. Due to a strange genetic quirk, only one Gerudo male is born every 100 years. As such, the Gerudo are a race almost exclusively made up of women. The average Gerudo lives for around 380-400 years. The Gerudo can breed with some other humanoid beings. At present, Gerudo Town is entirely locked off to all men of other races. Some women of other races are permitted entry but only after having proven themselves to be worthy. Some Gerudo are known to sneak out to find boyfriends.",,,,,

Jennifer runs an unsuccessful café with her neighbour. Naina has a best friend: her classmate, Rohit Patel. Her life is dull and overshadowed by her father's loss until Aman Mathur and his mother move in next door. Aman's cheerfulness gradually wins over Naina's family and he slowly starts to solve their problems. He suggests that they change the café to an Indian restaurant and its success alleviates their financial burdens. Aman encourages Naina to be happy and to live life to the fullest; she falls in love with him. Rohit also falls in love with Naina and asks Aman's help in expressing his feelings. Naina tells Rohit there is something she must say to him, leading him to think that she reciprocates his feelings. Naina reveals she is in love with Aman instead. Shaken, Rohit calls Aman to tell him what has happened. Naina goes to Aman's house and is shocked to see a wedding photograph of Aman and his wife, Priya. Heartbroken, she leaves. Aman's mother confronts him about what has happened. He says he loves Naina, but has decided to hide it because he is dying from a heart condition. He is not actually married; Priya is his childhood friend and doctor. Aman vows to bring Naina and Rohit together before he dies. He believes that Rohit will be able to provide for her better than he can. He hatches a plan to transform Naina and Rohit's bond, and gradually their friendship blossoms into love. Naina discovers his plan and chides Aman for trying to ruin her friendship with Rohit. Aman takes out Rohit's diary and confesses his feelings for Naina, saying (lying) that they are Rohit's words. Naina forgives Aman and Rohit. Rohit proposes to Naina, and she accepts. During Naina and Rohit's engagement as a result of excessive dancing and a lack of care, Aman has a heart attack. Only his mother knows he has been admitted to the hospital. Naina encounters Priya at a jewellery store, whom she recognises as Aman's wife. She introduces herself and her husband, Abhay, who reveals the truth about Aman. Shocked, Naina realises that Aman has sacrificed his love for her and leaves the mall in an emotional frenzy. Priya calls up Aman and informs him about what happened. Aman leaves the hospital and meets a frustrated Rohit, who asks why he and not Aman should marry Naina. Aman urges Rohit to marry Naina as a sign of respect for his dying wish to see Naina happy. Aman meets Naina, and they embrace while he tries to persuade her that he does not love her. Rohit and Naina's wedding, in which Aman attends, takes place soon afterward. Sometime after the wedding, Aman is on his deathbed and says goodbye to everyone. Shortly after he dies.",,,,,

Andy plans to put up with Miranda's excessive demands and humiliating treatment for one year in the hopes of getting a job as a reporter or writer somewhere else. At first, Andy fumbles with her job and fits in poorly with her gossipy, fashion-conscious co-workers. After she approaches art director Nigel to help her learn the ropes in the world of fashion, she begins to dress stylishly and starts showing effort for the position, accommodating all of Miranda's whims and fancies. Problems arise in her relationship with her chef boyfriend, Nate, who increasingly finds her spending all her time at her new boss's beck and call. Miranda starts to notice Andy's changed appearance and commitment and begins to give her more responsibility and complicated tasks to handle. Slowly but surely, Andy becomes more glamorous and begins aligning herself, unwittingly at first, to the Runway philosophy. She gradually begins to outperform Emily (Miranda’s previous junior assistant who was promoted to 1st assistant) at her job. Emily, meanwhile, is consumed with the thought of attending Paris Fashion Week as Miranda's assistant. At a charity benefit, she fails to provide information about a guest making his way to meet Miranda. Andy manages to save Miranda from embarrassment and is rewarded by being asked to replace Emily as Miranda's assistant at Fashion Week. Miranda tells Andy to inform Emily that she won't be going to Paris, but when Andy calls Emily, she is hit by a car and ends up in the hospital. She tells Emily the news, which infuriates her. When Andy tells Nate she is going to Paris, he is angered by her refusal to admit that she has become what she once ridiculed, and they break up.� In Paris, Andy learns from Miranda herself about her impending divorce. Later that night, Nigel tells Andy that he has accepted a job as creative director with rising designer James Holt. Further, Andy spends the night with a young writer, Christian Thompson, who reveals to her that Miranda is set to be replaced by Jacqueline Follet as editor of Runway. Feeling bad for Miranda in her current situation, Andy attempts to warn her but does not manage to get through. At a luncheon later that day, however, Miranda announces Jacqueline as the new creative director to Holt, leaving Andy and Nigel stunned. Later in the car, Miranda explains to Andy that she already knew of the plot to replace her and sacrificed Nigel instead to keep her own job. When Andy seems repulsed, Miranda points out that Andy did the same with Emily by stepping over her and agreeing to go to Paris. When they stop, Andy gets out and throws her cell phone into the fountain of the Place de la Concorde, leaving Miranda, Runway, and fashion behind Sometime later, Andy meets up with Nate and apologizes, though it is unclear if they eventually reconcile as Nate found a new job as a sous chef in Boston. The same day, Andy is interviewed and accepted to work at a major New York publication company. The editor recounts how he called Runway for a reference, and was told by Miranda herself that he would be an idiot not to hire Andy.",,,,,

Herb Kazzaz, Crackerjack Sugarman, Corduroy Jackson-Jackson, etc., join them at a dinner party, even though all of these characters (except BoJack) died earlier in the series. The guests discuss the best and worst parts of their lives. A new arrival, introduced as BoJack’s father Butterscotch, has the appearance of BoJack’s childhood idol Secretariat. Beatrice then invites the guests to a show, at which point BoJack expects to awake from a dream. However, BoJack remains in the dreamscape. In a theatre next door, Herb hosts a talent show featuring the guests, all of whom have their performances interrupted or ended by passing through an empty white door centre-stage. Following Sarah Lynn and Corduroy’s performance, BoJack goes outside for an emotional conversation with Butterscotch/Secretariat. Looking down, BoJack sees a silhouette of a horse floating face down in a swimming pool. BoJack starts to remember details of his bender from the previous episode, recalling that he went into the swimming pool and called Diane. BoJack finds himself unable to leave the theatre. Herb suggests that BoJack is not dreaming, but processing his own death. He finds a landline phone, calls out for Diane, and hears her voice through the phone. In their conversation, BoJack remembers that in real life, his call to Diane went to voicemail and he presumably drowned in the pool. Diane’s voice agrees to stay on the phone with BoJack as the tar envelops him. Final Episode (Nice While It Lasted): After the events of ""The View From Halfway Down"", a montage shows that BoJack was saved from drowning by the occupants of his former house. BoJack is convicted of breaking and entering and is sentenced to 14 months in a maximum security prison. A year later, BoJack is granted furlough and is picked up by Mr. Peanutbutter to go to Princess Carolyn and Judah's wedding. BoJack tells Todd that he is comfortable being in jail; he stays out of trouble and is beating his sobriety record. Todd convinces him that once he completes his sentence, he just has to set a new record every day. Bojack asks for representation should he decide to re-enter the business but Princess Carolyn only offers to 'recommend some excellent people'. Later, BoJack climbs onto the roof and finds Diane smoking. BoJack tells her he misses her, and she reminds him of the voicemail he left when he broke into his old house and nearly drowned. She tells him she thought he was dead for seven hours, and how she hates herself for feeling guilty about not taking care of him. BoJack apologizes. Diane reveals that she is happily married to her husband Guy, and they have moved to Houston together. She advises him that there are people who help you become who you are, but they are not meant to stay in your life forever. Then Bojack remarks how it’d be funny if this was the last time they spoke, and that was the last line of the entire series.",,,,,

The series follows the misadventures of Rick Sanchez and his grandson Morty Smith, who split their time between domestic life and interdimensional adventures. Rick is an eccentric and alcoholic mad scientist, who eschews many ordinary conventions such as school, marriage, love, and family. He frequently goes on adventures with his 14-year-old grandson, Morty, a kind-hearted but easily distressed boy, whose naïve but grounded moral compass plays counterpoint to Rick's Machiavellian ego. Morty frequently complains about Rick not showing him respect, Rick putting his life in danger, and Rick not giving him enough autonomy. On more than one occassion, Rick has forced Morty to kill. Despite this, Rick truly does love and care for Morty, and the two have a deep understanding of one another where they are otherwise largely misunderstood.",,,,,

The Primes have since lived for generations by transferring their consciousness into other human hosts. Because of this, the Primes are revered as divine and royal leaders of Sanctum, and have fairly easily quashed any sort of social resistance in the past. Hosts (which are rare on account of needing to have a certain blood type) are typically honoured to serve and their families are proud of them for doing so. Hosts’ families also comforted by the belief that the host’s mind is ‘merging’ with that of a Prime’s. As the ‘merging’ is done in a secret ceremony, only the Primes are aware of the truth, which is: 1) consciousness is transferred via cybernetic implant, and 2) and the host's mind is actually lost. When the show's protagonists (another group comparable in size/strength to Santum's society, and who are travelling from Earth - since destroyed in nuclear apocalypse) arrive on Sanctum, they find out the truth and seek to expose this to the people, and in doing so start a conflict with the Primes.",,,,,

The bacteria capture snippets of DNA from invading viruses and use them to create DNA segments known as CRISPR arrays. The CRISPR arrays allow the bacteria to ""remember"" the viruses (or closely related ones). If the viruses attack again, the bacteria produce RNA segments from the CRISPR arrays to target the viruses' DNA.

This also means that the number/source of contestants per constituencies varies. For instance, a candidate from the DMK is on a voter’s ballot in Tamil Nadu alongside one from the BJP, whereas in West Bengal, a candidate from the TMC would appear on a voter’s ballot alongside one from the BJP. India currently allocates constituencies (and thus seats in the Lok Sabha) to states based on their 2001 populations, rather than their current populations, aiming to give more representation to states that have had more successful family planning initiatives since then. For example,Madhya Pradesh has 29 constituencies (2.5 million people per seat) to Tamil Nadu’s 39 (1.8 million per seat). In “proportional representation,” political parties gain seats as a proportion of the national vote they gain (rather than gaining seats based on elections in individual districts). This means all parties who want seats in the Lok Sabha will be represented on all voter ballots (regardless of where they campaign). In this system, if a party wins 10% of the votes across the whole country, they get to occupy 10% of the legislature’s seats with representatives of their choice. In general, they are required to – prior to the election – publish a ranked list of their prospective candidates in order of priority, which means, if that party wins 10% of seats, the first 10% of those candidates fill those seats.",,,,,

He argued that the individual’s sense of responsibility must be an essential component of one’s identity. For Levinas, this responsibility must also precede their recognition of the latter's identity. Not doing so, could allow the individual to be discriminative about the ways in which they seek to exercise their sense of commitment. His framework does not argue in favour of an invisibilisation of cultural identities, it seeks to position responsibility before the individual's recognition of cultural differences. This framework of ethical responsibility has been questioned by critics and scholars like Rachel Walsh who oppose the ways in which Levinas seeks to decontextualize the cultural encounter between the privileged and the oppressed. For Walsh, “the language in which the individual responds to the other” and the ways in which they seek to manifest their feeling of responsibility are precisely determined by the cultural contexts in which they reside, and the individual must condition their sense of commitment through an active recognition of identities within a cultural context. For Walsh, recognition of the self and the oppressed individual's identity must precede their sense of commitment.",,,,,

The preface sets out the book’s project: The world doesn’t matter to us the way it used to. The intense and meaningful lives of Homer’s Greeks, and the grand hierarchy of meaning that structured Dante’s medieval Christian world, both stand in stark contrast to our secular age. The world used to be, in its various forms, a world of sacred, shining things. The shining things now seem far away. The first chapter, entitled “Our Contemporary Nihilism,” focuses on the angst caused by the many choices we now have compared to previous generations. In response people typically adopt a self-confident persona to mask their insecurity, or they become paralyzed by their obsessions and addictions. But neither mollifies our existential anguish, as anxiety pervades western civilization, as our former religious moorings have been lost. In the Middle Ages, for better or worse, nearly everyone believed that God created them and determined their fate. One could choose to turn away from God and sin in medieval times, but being an atheist or rejecting religious ethics altogether wasn’t an available choice. But today ethical prescriptions are tenuous, and nihilism is a viable option. The faith that once comforted does so no longer—today even fervent believers face existential questions. But Dreyfus and Kelly present us with a third option: the ability to find your own sacred meaning in the everyday— the ritual of drinking your daily cup of coffee, the music that puts you in a trance of pure bliss, or the sacred attachment you have with a sports team. They describe this as a practice of neo-polytheism, where we imbue sacred meaning in the flow of our daily lives. One where our desires, and fancies come to define our own personal God. Yet this everyday is often informed by the vices of capitalist consumption, of falling into the trap of advertisement and vanity. By finding meaning in your own individual niche, one also risks erasing the embedded moral conflicts, and inequalities that accompany the expensive world of coffee and sports. And they also hold the risk of losing touch with community, and the collective force of sharing religious experience in an institutionalized setting.",,,,,

More than 40% of Americans felt “disgusted” or “helpless” about climate change, according to a survey published by researchers at Yale University. A 2020 poll from the APA found that more than half of respondents were somewhat or extremely anxious about the effects of climate change on their own mental health. Though not officially classified in the DSM-5, the term therapists use to classify and treat mental illnesses, there’s a name for this state of despair that has emerged from academic texts and media since as recently as 2007: eco-anxiety. In some ways, climate change anxiety is a rational response, said Leslie Davenport, a therapist based in Tacoma, Washington. “Eco-anxiety is a natural response to a threat. And this is a very real threat,” Davenport said. Yet it can also debilitate. In college, I began a campaign to shut down fracking in Los Angeles County. Within months, I burned out. Constantly contemplating the impact of fracking on our atmosphere and communities was making it difficult for me to function at a basic level. Because of this tension between eco-anxiety’s role as a rational but potentially debilitating response, there’s no clear, standard definition as to when eco-anxiety is unhealthy, if it ever is. “That’s one of the questions we really need to be asking,” Clayton said. “Anxiety is not pleasant to experience, but it’s not necessarily a bad thing. It’s an emotional signal that we need to be paying attention. Definition: Medicalization is the process of labelling ‘eco-anxiety’ as an illness requiring formal diagnosis of symptoms, and prescribed treatment through biochemical, psychiatric, or intervention by formal medical apparatuses such as admittance in a hospital.",,,,,

The aim is to put a price on carbon emissions—an actual monetary value—so that the costs of climate impacts and the opportunities for low-carbon energy options are better reflected in our production and consumption choices. There are two widely supported strategies for carbon pricing. A carbon tax directly imposes a (progressive) tax on each unit of greenhouse gas emissions - directly establishing a price for carbon consumed - and gives firms (and households, depending on the scope) an incentive to reduce pollution whenever doing so would cost less than paying the tax. A cap-and-trade model, on the other hand, sets a maximum level of pollution - a cap - and distributes emissions permits among firms that produce emissions. Companies must have a permit to cover each unit of pollution they produce. They can obtain these permits either through an initial allocation or State led auction, as well as trade them on secondary markets, creating a carbon price. Whilst the maximum pollution quantity is set in advance, the trading price of permits fluctuates, becoming more expensive when demand is high relative to supply (for example when the economy is growing) and cheaper when demand is lower (for example in a recession). A price on pollution is therefore created as a result of setting a ceiling on the overall quantity of emissions.",,,,,

Many people now know about McCandless and how the 24-year-old idealist bailed out of his middle-class suburban life, donated his $24,000 in savings to charity, and embarked on a two-year hitchhiking odyssey that led him to Alaska and the deserted Fairbanks City Transit bus number 142, which still sits, busted and rusting, 20 miles down the Stampede Trail. For 67 days, he ate mostly squirrel, ptarmigan, and porcupine. After a few months, a moose hunter found McCandless’s decomposed body in a sleeping bag inside the bus, where he had starved to death. This tragic story was told by Jon Krakauer in the January 1993 issue of Outside and later in his bestselling 1997 book, Into the Wild. The book, and a 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, helped elevate the McCandless saga to the status of modern myth. And that, in turn, has given rise to a unique and curious phenomenon in Alaska: McCandless pilgrims, inspired by his story, who are determined to see the bus for themselves. ""The Magic Bus"" has become a pilgrimage destination for trekkers who camp at the vehicle, some of whom have gotten into their own difficulties or even died due to the Teklanika River. They camp at the bus for days, sometimes weeks, write essays in the various logbooks stowed inside, and ponder the impact that McCandless’s anti-materialist ethic, free-spirited travels, and time in the Alaskan wild has had on how they perceive the world. From almost the moment he was found, the meaning of Chris McCandless's life and lonely death has been fiercely argued. The debate falls into two camps: Krakauer's visionary seeker; a romantic figure inspired by what they see as his free-spirited idealism; or, as many Alaskans see it, an unprepared person who had fundamentally misjudged the wilderness he'd wanted so desperately to commune with.",,,,,

Roosevelt’s administration to visualize a new roadmap toward national excellence under the adage, “Search for a usable American past.” Now, 85 years after its creation, administrators at the school where the painting resides have decided that there is nothing “usable” in Arnautoff’s images. George Washington High School has decided to paint over the 1,600-square-foot mural.The city’s school board voted unanimously to approve the repaint. Why? Because of its blunt retelling of history. Across 13 frescos, the painter renders an unvarnished portrait of Washington as a slave owner who incentivized settlers and troops to destroy Native American populations and land. One landscape includes a pack of soldiers painted in greyscale walking by the fallen corpse of an Indigenous person.Reactions to this gruesome scene have been mixed. Opponents of the mural have described it as a symbol of racial animus. In voting for its destruction, the school described their decision as a form of reparations for historic racial injustices against African Americans and Native Americans. While they recognize the need to keep history complicated, the anti-muralists also see the Arnautoff painting as a decontextualized daily problem for marginalized students and staff. The Reflection and Action Working Group, a committee of activists, students, artists, and others put together by the district, concluded in February that Arnautoff’s work “glorifies slavery, genocide, colonization, white supremacy, oppression, etc.” Black people and Native Americans in the school district have asked for the mural’s removal as a way to address continuing racial inequality.But according to a report by the New York Times, many other students favor the fresco. One student wrote, “The fresco shows us exactly how brutal colonization and genocide really were and are. The fresco is a warning and reminder of the fallibility of our hallowed leaders.” Art historians and alumni have also come to the painting’s defense, saying that it must be preserved as an example of WPA art and a frank representation of how cruel early America’s leading figures could be.",,,,,

This year, the value of a ticket for the event was $35,000 and while some invited attendees don’t have to pay for this ticket, many believe that the cost of attending this event reflects an unnecessary extravagance. While the event is often viewed as a reflection of fashionable high culture, many attendees decided to show up wearing clothes that defy existing ideas surrounding what is and isn’t “fashionable”. From Alexandria Ocasio Cortez to Cara Delevingne and Carolyn B. Maloney, several politicians and celebrities decided to wear clothes that explicitly seek to make a progressive socio-political statement. According to Judith Thurman, this year’s Met Gala raises questions about the position of “protest fashion” in contemporary society. She argues that women throughout history have used fashion as a means of expressing their resistance to oppressive institutions and frameworks. However, several individuals have pointed out that the attempt to take progressive politics inside an event like the Met Gala has ultimately added to the event’s legitimacy. Furthermore, while the event was going on, several Black Lives Matter protestors were being arrested for calling out the police for its unwillingness to protect marginalized communities. Given the nature of these events, several activists have questioned the validity of carrying progressive political statements into spaces that are potentially repeating the very cycle of oppression that the protestors outside the event are fighting against.",,,,,

Sometime after gaining her freedom in 1827, she became a well-known anti-slavery speaker. Her speech was delivered at the Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio, on May 29, 1851. If there is a canon of African-American women’s rhetoric, Sojourner Truth’s speech “Ain’t I a Woman?” is a central text in that collection. It was an aptly chosen name, as illustrated by her speech, in which she at once refutes the prevailing myth that women are weaker than men while challenging social definitions of womanhood—which relies upon ideas about white women’s femininity and purity. Most people are familiar with the 1863 popular version of Sojourner Truth's famous, “Ain’t I a woman” speech but they have no idea that this popular version, while based off of Sojourner’s original 1851 speech, is not Sojourner's speech and is vastly different from Sojourner’s original 1851 speech. This popular but inaccurate version was written and published in 1863, (12 years after Sojourner gave the ""Ain't I a woman"" speech), by a white abolitionist named Frances Dana Barker Gage. Curiously, Gage chose to represent Sojourner speaking in a stereotypical 'southern black slave accent', rather than in Sojourner’s distinct upper New York State low-Dutch accent. In an issue of the Kalamazoo Daily Telegraph, an article states that Truth prided herself on “fairly correct English, which is in all senses a foreign tongue to her. . . . People who report her often exaggerate her expressions, putting in to her mouth the most marked southern dialect.” For comparison, this is an excerpt from the text: “That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud-puddles, or gives me any best place! And ain’t I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me!” Gage’s version: “Dat man ober dar say dat women needs to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have de best place eberywhar.

As a follow-up of this declaration and in order to have a blueprint for the tasks ahead, a conference titled Mumbai Ilakha Mahar Parishad (Mumbai Province Mahar Conference) was organised from May 30 to June 1, 1936 at Mumbai. In the conference, Ambedkar made a detailed and passionate speech, which was published under the title “Mukti Kon Pathe?” (“Which Path to Salvation?”). In “Mukti Kon Pathe?” Ambedkar outlined two considerations in changing religion – existential and spiritual. In explaining the existential consideration, he mainly indicated the pitiful plight of Dalits. They suffered atrocities at the feeblest violation of the caste code as perceived by the caste Hindus. Coming to the existential aspect of this problem, he observed that the lack of strength of Dalits was the root cause of the perpetuation of this conflict. Dalits did not possess any of the three strengths human beings are expected to possess, namely, the strengths of numbers, wealth and education. If Dalits relied upon their own strength, they could not hope to escape their prevailing miserable state. He thus justifies his call for conversion as an existential necessity for Dalits. It followed that the religion they convert to should have a sizeable community in the country, with Islam, Christianity and Sikhism implicitly constituting his zone of consideration. The spiritual consideration in the change of religion was related with enhancing the worth of an individual. Since the Hindu religion did not have any place for an individual, it could not provide spiritual solace to anyone. According to Ambedkar, the real objective of a religion should be the spiritual development of individuals: “[B]irth of an individual is not for service of the society, it is for his or her own emancipation.” He saw the necessity of three things for the development of an individual – compassion, equality and freedom, which he saw in Buddhism.",,,,,

He maintained that his party’s struggle for justice and equality will encompass the concerns of Dalits, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and several other religious and social minorities. The current president of the party, Mayawati will soon be contesting for the 2022 UP Legislative Assembly elections. In the past, Mayawati has found some electoral success by following what Paul R. Brass calls the “coalition of extremes” strategy, through which she advocated for a sense of unity between Dalits, Muslims and Brahmins. In the 2007 Assembly elections, BSP had come to power by winning 206/403 constituencies after persistently advocating for a Dalit-Muslim-Brahmin “brotherhood”. Motivated by these events, the BSP is currently trying to repeat the strategy that brought them electoral success several years ago. On 18th July 2021, Mayawati announced a “Brahmin Sammelan” (Brahmin conference) through which she accused the ruling BJP government of exploiting the Brahmin community by falsely earning their trust and ignoring their requirements thereafter. Mayawati is actively making these claims in a context where the Brahmins and the Thakurs are at odds with one another given that the nominated CM belongs to the latter. Furthermore, out of the total of 7 BJP MPs that were inducted into the Council of ministers by the Prime Minister, only one was a Brahmin. These moves have motivated the BSP and other opposition parties in UP like the Samajwadi Party to start lobbying for votes from the Brahmin voter base. Many however, believe that the BSP’s proposed strategy is destined to fail because of the polarised nature of Indian politics today. According to Hisam Siddiqui, the party’s strategy is currently at risk of alienating several Muslims within the state who might instead jump ship to support the Samajwadi Party who had also found electoral success in 2012. Furthermore, this strategy is also alienating several Dalit scholars and activists who believe that the political ambitions of the party currently are directly contradicting the intention with which it was started. Despite all these criticisms, the party leaders are confident and feel like their inability to incorporate the Brahmin voter base has allowed the BJP to construct an atmosphere of fear and hatred within UP. They feel that it is incumbent upon them to reach out to the Brahmin voter base so that they may realise that their interests need not be in alignment with a casteist framework of society.",,,,,

Instead, alliances like the TNA (Tamil National Alliance) and TNPF (Tamil National People’s Front) have rallied with the intention of securing greater levels of autonomy by supporting a federal structure that accommodates their demand for “regional self-rule"""". The leaders of the political alliances have also limited their expression of trans-national solidarity, fearing that doing so would further legitimise the claims of the majoritarian Sinhala nationalists, who sought to characterise them as outsiders without a legitimate claim in Sri Lanka. Instead, they have decided to assert their distinctiveness as a community with a historic Tamil presence and heritage within Sri Lanka itself. Context-2: On several occasions, the Sri Lankan government has arrested various members of the political alliances for actively memorialising historic Sri Lankan Tamil activists like Lt. Col. Thileepan. The government has also limited any attempts at commemorating the Tamilians who had lost their lives at the hands of the Sri Lankan government during their struggle with the LTTE. Such acts of repression by the Sri Lankan government have significantly hampered the ability of Tamil leaders and activists at emphasising their distinctive sense of self as a community within the nation. While many believe that the claim to a trans-national, pan-Tamil identity allows for a greater visibility of the Sri Lankan Tamil cause by encouraging international expressions of solidarity, others believe that this approach would allow several non-Sri Lankan Tamils to misunderstand, dilute and appropriate their struggle within the Nation. As of today, Palermo City, Italy has recognised the “genocide of Eelam Tamils perpetrated by the Sri Lankan state” and a few months ago, the British foreign secretary had expressed his desire to secure a level of funding that would allow a thorough investigation of the war crimes in Sri Lanka.",,,,,

The stoics believed that the expression of emotions like fear, anger and grief emerged from an error of judgement, and they often advocated for a sense of rational “stoic calm” that would allow the individual to carefully respond to their situations. Stoics never actively vouched for a sense of passivity, rather they believed that an ideal political leader could influence significant change by exercising stoic self-restraint and censoring their “emotional excesses”. The stoics however primarily focused on advising the individual about navigating their lives in the world as it exists. Its opposition to emotional expression has been a key aspect that has worried several scholars about how it disproportionately privileges certain types of leaders over others.",,,,,

Given the Indian Constitution's guarantee of equality, some other High Courts have struck down identical provisions as violative of the right to equality. However, the Kerala High Court, while recognizing the right to equality, instead chose to hold that the provision must be construed as ""a protection against exploitation of a woman worker by requiring her to work during night hours without her consent"". It also held that in a case where the woman herself seeks appointment by waiving the special privilege granted to her under the provision, she could not be denied employment by citing the provision. Thus, the Kerala High Court, instead of striking down the provision, held that it can continue to operate but must be interpreted as: 1) it could not be used to deny women employment if they were willing to work during night hours; 2) At the same time, employers could not legally compel women to work during night hours",,,,,

A core use of Blockchain is cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Etherium, which are able to function as a decentralized currency without a central bank or government’s control. The blockchain is used to store a ledger of transactions on each coin, and the verification system keeps in place an artificial scarcity that prevents more from being ""printed out.""

Candidates submit 'bid books' outlining their strengths e.g. their venue, accommodation, accessibility, budgeting, fees etc. The debating community reviews the bids through Q&As, discussions etc. Bids are voted upon by representatives from every country that attends WUDC.

The Qianlong Emperor instituted a system of selecting the Panchen Lama by a lottery that used a Golden Urn with names wrapped in clumps of barley.

In 1995, the Dalai Lama chose to proceed with the selection of the next Panchen Lama without the use of the Golden Urn, while the Chinese government insisted that it must be used. This has led to two rival Panchen Lamas: Gyaincain Norbu as chosen by the Chinese government's process, and Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as chosen by the Dalai Lama. However, Nyima was abducted by the Chinese government shortly after being chosen as the Panchen Lama and has not been seen in public since 1995. The Current Dalai Lama now states that after his passing, the office of the Dalai Lama will cease to exist and that there will be no reincarnation in a bid to stop the CCP from appointing their own Dalai Lama via their handpicked Panchen.",,,,,

There is an elite group, though, that is chosen to live in a virtual paradise known as “The Offshore” (only 3% of the population). Every year, each 20-year-old gets a chance to make it to the island paradise by taking a series of tests known as “The Process”. Only three percent of the candidates succeed and qualify to leave the impoverished Inland area. There is a rebellion growing from an organisation known as The Cause, who seek to end “The Process” and redistribute Offshore’s wealth. Currently, the Cause's plan is to find a candidate with a high chance of passing, to enter the test and to sabotage it. The plan is to corrupt the data (and potentially delay “The Process""), shutting off the power source and/or to be a person living in the Offshore that would continuously update ""The Cause"" and do their missions. You are a 20 year-old that has a high chance of passing “The Process” . Before taking part in “The Process”, a member from ""The Cause"" asks you to execute their plan of sabotaging the whole system.
