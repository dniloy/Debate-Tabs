9,Grand Finals,"Aurat March is a feminist protest movement organised in Pakistan. While they have political demands, they are primarily an activist group operating mostly via protest and demonstrations.  They have been endorsed by the Lady Health Workers Association and include representatives from multiple women's rights organizations. Since inception, Aurat March has called for more accountability for violence against women, and to support women who experience violence and harassment at the hands of security forces, in public spaces, at home, and at the workplace. They also demand economic justice, including implementation of labor rights, the Sexual Harassment Against Women in the Workplace Act 2010, recognition of women's input to the ‘care economy’ as unpaid labor, and provision of maternity leaves and daycare centers to ensure women's inclusion in the labor force. They have also vocally supported other left-leaning movements and organisations in Pakistan, such as Pashtun Tahafuz Movement, and are thus also viewed controversially by segments of the populace. Critics claim that the movement's radical language is a reason for why they do not have more widespread support in Pakistani society.","TH, as Aurat March, would become a political party and contest future elections in Pakistan.
