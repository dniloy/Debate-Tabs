,Round,Info Slide,Motion
0,Round 1,"You are the founder of a large international pharmaceutical company. You have created a special aphrodisiac named 'Liquid Lust.'  It turns people on in any context and guarantees orgasm when consumed before sexual activity.
Anticipation of product launch has massively driven up your company's stock price. Competitors Johnson&Johnson and Pfizer are eager to develop something similar and are desperate to learn the formula.
While you have harnessed company resources and the efforts of several departments to create Liquid Lust, you are the only one who knows all the ingredients. The crucial active ingredient of Liquid Lust is human breastmilk.",THBT keeping the ingredients of Liquid Lust as a trade secret is a superior business strategy to patenting it.
1,Round 2,"CHALLENGE: You will lose one speaker point if you do not include a rhyme (like a rhyming couplet or a limerick) in the intro of your speech.
INFO SLIDE: Kpop idol groups tend to designate specific roles to individual members which align with their strengths. Typically the main vocalist is the most talented/well-trained singer and gets more lines. Visuals are usually the most attractive member, and often feature predominantly in the group's brand and promotions.",THBT the life of the 'visual' is preferable to that of the 'main vocalist' in a popular Kpop group.
2,Round 3,"CHALLENGE: You will gain a speaker point if your introduction includes an impression of Donald Trump.
MOTION: Heaven banning would involve social media companies using bots to interact with banned individuals while preventing real people from seeing their posts. Someone who has been heaven banned would not necessarily realise they had been banned. Social media companies would have discretion over the process of heaven banning, e.g. they might phase in bot followers.",TH supports the use of heaven banning.
3,Round 4,"CHALLENGE: You will gain a speaker point if you sing your introduction.
CONTEXT SLIDE: You are a teenage girl living in a world where Taylor Swift has disappeared without explanation. One day your childhood doll comes to life and claims to contain the consciousness of Taylor Swift. The doll says it is the real Taylor Swift and asks to be returned to her body. The doll is dependent on you for mobility.",TH would refuse to return the doll to its body.
4,Round 5,"CONTEXT SLIDE: For the purposes of this debate, glaciers (e.g. ice sheets, icebergs, ice shelves) have suddenly developed sentience, communication and the capacity to consciously control the pace of their melting or stop it entirely. Glaciers cannot stop the process of global warming or its other adverse consequences (e.g. sea levels may rise at a different pace, but this does not affect carbon emissions or the prevalence of bushfires). Nobody else apart from the glacier species is aware that glaciers have developed intelligent thought.","This house, as the progressive glacier movement, would campaign for glaciers to voluntarily acquiesce to global warming."
5,Semifinals,"You are the leader of a small medieval city state with a peasant population of 10,000 in addition to an elite military guard of 1000. Your scouts have reported a barbarian invasion from the north numbering 10,000 due to arrive in a week.  Your city is fortified with a wall 10m tall and 3m thick. The city has supplies which would normally last a few weeks. The people have faith in you as a leader, but are understandably fearful of the invasion. There are no reinforcements or allies. Winter is co",This house would immediately surrender to the barbarians.
6,Grand Final,"For the purposes of this debate, assume that all gods exist in a competitive market. Gods must compete for human belief in order to gain strength. If belief falls below a certain level, the God will exist only as a memory, or even disappear eventually. For example, Greek gods are a memory but have no concrete form nor power. There are innumerable forgotten gods who society has simply moved past. Gods can be created or brought back into existence if human belief in them is sufficient. Gods themselves, while shaped in appearance and priorities by how humans imagine them, are all knowing and autonomous. Humans are unaware of the deity marketplace.  Minor gods are either gods in non-major religions or minor gods in major religions.",This house supports the unionisation of minor gods.
7,Novice Grand Final,,"This house, as an incel, would get chin surgery."
