0,Round 1,"Philanthrocapitalism is a way of doing philanthropy, which mirrors the way that business is done in the for-profit world. It may involve venture philanthropy that actively invests in social programs to pursue specific philanthropic goal that would yield return on investment over the long term, or in a more passive form whereby ""social investors"" benefit from investing in socially-responsible programs. Philanthrocapitalism has grown significantly more popular since the 1990s.",This House regrets the rise of Philanthrocapitalism.
1,Round 2,"Sentencing algorithms are a tool used to sentence criminal offenders. A large amount of data is input into the algorithm (including the offender’s age, crime and criminal history amongst other things). The algorithm synthesises this information in order to predict the chances of recidivism, and recommends a punishment to the judge as a result.",This house supports the development and use of sentencing algorithms.
2,Round 3,"On August 13 2020 the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Israel signed a ‘normalisation agreement’ known as the Abraham Accords, brokered by the United States. The treaty recognises the sovereignty of each state and establishes protocols for diplomatic procedures such as the exchange of ambassadors. Israel has signed similar normalisation deals with Egypt (in 1979) and Jordan (in 1994). In September, despite irate protests from Palestine, the Arab League refused to condemn the normalisation agreement.",This House regrets the Arab League’s refusal to condemn the Israeli-UAE normalisation deal.
3,Round 4,"You are an avid progressive. Although you initially supported Bernie, you have rallied your support around Biden in the past six months. In the lead-up to the 2020 election you successfully apply to be an election monitor (despite the position being supposedly independent). On the day of the election (November 3rd) you uncover irrefutable evidence of fraud by the Democratic Party in the course of serving your role. Although you believe the evidence will not be revealed later if you destroy it, there is a small chance that there exists other evidence proving the fraud.","This House, as such a person, would choose to destroy the evidence."
4,Round 5,"The United States maintains a ‘State Sponsors of Terrorism’ List (SSTL). There are only four countries on the list: Syria, (since 1979), Iran (since 1984), Sudan (since 1993) and North Korea (since 2017). Being on the list has a series of consequences: heavy restrictions on aid, limitations on exports to the countries in question (in particular a ban on defence products) and a series of other restrictions. Sudan is on the list due to their alleged funding and support of Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, including connections to the bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.
In 2019 Omar al-Bashir, the long time dictator of Sudan was ousted and replaced with a Transitional Military Council (TMC). Sudan has been heavily hit by the COVID 19 pandemic: 10 million people in Sudan face food shortages and Sudan’s inflation rate has consistently sat at above 100%.
This year Mike Pompeo visited Khartoum to indicate support for the new government. Pompeo offered to remove Sudan from the SSTL in exchange for a $330m compensation pay-out directly to the American victims of Al-Qaeda. The initial assessment for the compensation pay-out by American courts was an amount over $10 billion.","This House, as the Transitional Military Council of Sudan, would pay the United States compensation in exchange for being removed from the ‘State Sponsors of Terrorism’ list."
5,Round 6,"The Kafala system is a system used to monitor migrant labourers, working primarily in the construction and domestic sectors in Gulf Cooperation Council member states and a few neighbouring countries, namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Lebanon, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). A person from the host country (the country you want to immigrate to) sponsors your visa and takes responsibility for your stay in the host country. This system has helped a lot of people to be able to immigrate.
Currently, the USA has had a lot of problems in terms of determining their immigration policies. Everyday many immigrants have to go through a rigorous process and even after that be rejected for a visa.",This House would implement the Kafala system for immigrants in the USA.
6,Novice Grand Final,,This House regrets the glorification of the narrative that hard work is the key to success.
7,Grand Final,"In just war theory ‘jus post bellum’ refers to moral requirements that states that conduct war assist in post-war reconstruction and settlement (e.g. signing a proper peace treaty, rebuilding infrastructure, establishing a competent judiciary and potentially even conducting trials for war crimes.). The international codification of jus post bellum would mean that states that fail to properly adhere to such requirements would likely face strict sanctions from the global community.",This House supports the international codification of jus post bellum.
