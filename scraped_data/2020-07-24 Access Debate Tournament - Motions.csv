2,Round 3,,"This House believes that contemporary social movements should focus on class differences rather than on identity-based discrimination (e.g. gender, race)"
3,Round 4,"Pacific island states (e.g. Fiji, Kiribati, Solomon Islands) are highly foreign aid-dependent. In recent times, China has significantly increased its foreign aid contributions to Pacific island states in exchange for their support for Chinese interests (e.g. signing onto Belt and Road projects, supporting China in the UN etc). However, there have been numerous concerns raised by Australia, the US and the EU (among others) about this diplomatic shift toward China, as well as regarding the amount of debt that Pacific island states are taking on when signing onto Belt and Road projects.","This House, as a Pacific island state, would reject Chinese developmental assistance"
4,Round 5,"Power-sharing agreements are agreements that divide political power in the state among different groups in society, such as different religions or political parties. For instance, after the Lebanese civil war, a system was implemented in which seats in parliament as well as government posts are proportionally divided among different religious denominations; the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim, the speaker of parliament a Shiite Muslim and the president a Maronite Christian. Power-sharing agreements guarantee a fixed distribution of power among different groups, as opposed to a system of unrestricted democracy where the distribution of power may change over time.","In post-conflict societies, This House prefers power-sharing agreements to unrestricted democracy."

6,Semifinals,,This House believes that developing countries should prioritise the massive construction of infrastructure over the direct provision of high subsidies and social welfare
7,Grand Final,"Extended adolescence is a recent phenomenon observed in many societies by sociologists, in which teenagers and young adults delay their assumption of adult responsibilities and their transition into what has traditionally been considered full adulthood. For instance, teenagers in the US in the 21st century are less likely to date or to have an after-school job than their predecessors were before 2000, while young adults in their 20s are more likely to still live at home and receive financial support from their parents.
In contrast, early independence refers to the converse model, in which teenagers are more likely to explore “adult” activities such as working or dating during their teenage years, and young adults achieve traditional markers of adulthood (moving out, being financially independent, committing to a career, etc) soon after reaching the legal age of majority.","This House believes that middle-class families should adopt a model of extended adolescence for their children, rather than one of early independence."
