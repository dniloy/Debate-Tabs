3,Semifinals,"You are an emotional individual. You are unable to keep secrets or feelings hidden especially those of the romantic kind. You've told everyone about how you love a girl named Michellin except Michellin herself.
You are studying in a religious college similar to a Catholic college where boys outnumber girls by 8 to1 and dating is looked down upon in your college. Due to the difference in gender ratio, most girls are notably dating better looking individuals. You are pretty average on the scale in the whole batch at the absolute middle and thus if someone is dating on the basis of looks you're still a lot lower than most of the other guys.
Michellin is a girl with a very bubbly personality and you both share a Language and Literature class where you talk and you also play chess.
The rumours about your crush have reached everywhere, even to teachers but she does not seem to react differently. You start feeling that she may like you because of how dear she holds you and acts around you.

4,Grand Final,"Humans have invented a device that converts cat language into our language and vice versa. The translation is 100% accurate and conveys every emotion and nuance in their tone of voice. This has allowed us to communicate with cats more better and form much closer bonds with them. This device is a one-time solution meaning it is permanent. It has shortened the life-spans of the cats by a margin and made them more susceptible to diseases. Cats with this device also have consent so they have similar rights to human rights as they can communicate with us on an equal level now.

It has been recently diagnosed with a terminal disease limiting its lifespan. You are distressed about this and want to make the kittens remaining life an enjoyable experience for it. You feel that getting the device for your cat might potentially help you make its remaining life better for both of you however this means that the life of this cat will be shortened even further beyond its terminal disease. With this in your mind you are tasked with this decision.","TH, as the individual, would choose to install the device despite the consequences for the cat"
