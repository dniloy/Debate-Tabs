2,Varsity Round 3,"TERF: abbreviation for Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist
The exclusionary of trans-women from feminism or women label have been widely opposed, and deemed transphobic by liberals.  People who support the idea of this exclusion are called 'TERFs' which is a label meant to be derogatory as the adjective 'radical' and 'exclusionary' are not desirable traits in an open and progressive society.
There are many reasons why people become 'TERFs', ranging from the very conservative ideas that everyone should be subject to the sex and gender they were assigned at birth, to the more moderate ones where some degree of sexual & gender fluidity may be acceptable.
For the purpose of this debate, 'TERFs' are people whose beliefs are as follows:1) Sex & gender are different things, where sex is related to biology and gender is related to expression.2) Everyone, regardless of their sex, is able to freely express themselves like whichever gender (or lack thereof) they want.3) Sex is not a social construct and should not be determined by self-identification. For example: a biological male athlete who identifies as a woman can't participate in a woman's category.4) The only legitimate change for sex change is when individuals possess medical conditions called 'gender dysphoria' and commit to a gradual, yet complete, sex re-assignment surgery.","As citizens concerned with social justice, TH prefers forwarding Marxists' school of thought that emphasizes on material inequality as a primary source of oppression, rather than intersectionality concept in which identities like race, religion, and sexuality majorly affect them"

9,Varsity Quarterfinals,"Some historian believes that Buddhism is a religion that was built as a response against the unequal caste system that Hinduism employ at the time. This, combined with the pervasive corruption within Brahmana and Kshatriya caste make Buddhism seems appealing, especially for the lower caste member of Indian society at the time. One of the core principles of Buddhism that appeals to Indian society at the time was that everyone can access enlightenment regardless of their societal standing, something that was previously thought only accessible to those of the upper caste, especially Brahmana.
Despite the progressivity, there have been some rules in Buddhism monastery that are blatantly discriminatory to women, such as the addition of extra 58 rules that apply only to the female monk that some scholar argues to be somewhat sexist. Some of these rules even contemporary female monks themselves still argue to be sexist. (Example includes but not limited to; Not being able to go out alone at night, explicit requirement to be respectful to the younger male monk)
Historian argues that this was done to cater to the social dynamics during the time, as it was necessary knowing the framework in which monks survives is by voluntary donation.
