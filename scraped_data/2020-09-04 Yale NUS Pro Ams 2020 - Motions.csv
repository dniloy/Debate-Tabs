6,Semifinals,"Jammu & Kashmir is the Indian held territory of occupied Kashmir. Azad Kashmir is the Pakistan held territory of Occupied Kashmir.   In 2019, the Indian government abrogated Article 370A of the constitution, revoking Kashmir's status as an autonomous region. A few weeks ago, ahead of the one-year anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370A, the Pakistan government published a new official map of the country which marks the Indian-held part of Kashmir as disputed territory (thus rejecting the Indian government's abrogation of 370A).
The Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) is a political organisation active in both Pakistan-administered and Indian-administered Kashmir. It is a militant organization. Even though the JKLF has only Muslim members, it is notionally secular. It continues to assert that a secular, independent Kashmir free of both India and Pakistan is its eventual goal.","TH, as the Jammu & Kashmir Liberation Front, would ally itself with the Pakistani government to push back against abrogation of Article 370 by the Indian government"
