8,Pro-Am Finals,"The Inside-Out-Reader is a database of emotions which is freely accessible to the public. Using this database, everyone can look up any individuals' current emotional states on various emotional scales (e.g., Happiness, Fear), but not the cause of the emotion. The Inside-Out-Reader is objective and absolute, so that a '7' on one person's emotional scale is equivalent to a '7' on that same scale for any other person. The Inside-Out-Reader doesn't store any information about past feelings - only the emotions a person experiences at that exact moment are tracked. To look up an individual on the Inside-Out-Reader, one needs identifiable information to find them (e.g., their full name or I.D.)",THP a world with the Inside-Out-Reader
