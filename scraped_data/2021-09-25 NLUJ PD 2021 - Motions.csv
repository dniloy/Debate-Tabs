0,Round 1,"""A """"death-qualified jury"""" is a jury eligible to sit on a case where capital punishment is a prospective punishment (first guilt is determined, then the jury separately votes as to whether the guilty party should be sentenced to prison or death). In addition to all the standard qualifications, jurors on a death-qualified jury (1) cannot be opposed to the death penalty, and (2) cannot believe that the death penalty must be imposed in all instances of capital murder. ""","That, in countries with the death penalty, we would abolish death qualification requirements for juries."
1,Round 2,,That we would remove urban planning rules concerned with designing buildings primarily based on their appearance.
2,Round 3,"With the advent of apps like Robinhood in the USA, Zerodha in India, etc. which substantially reduce brokerage costs, provide understandable User Interfaces and thereby enable general public participation in financial markets, retail investments have grown substantially around the world. This phenomenon has been called the ""democratisation of finance"".",That we regret the democratisation of finance.
3,Round 4,"Eastern EU member states with right-wing governments have campaigned against gay rights as a central part of their ideology e.g. Poland’s President Andrzej Duda campaigned against an “LGBT ideology” and wanted to ban teaching of gay rights in schools. Hungary proposed a constitutional amendment to require children to be brought up with a “Christian” interpretation of gender roles, and a law that would effectively ban adoptions by same-sex couples.","Assuming it were possible, that, as the European Union, we would sanction EU members states that do not ensure protection of the LGBTQIA+ community."
4,Round 5,"When Colin Kaepernick decided to take the knee to call attention to the issue of racial inequality and police brutality, Nike, the sporting gear giant, chose to publicly back him up. They cast him in multiple polarising advertisements and gave him a contract for signature merchandise. The advertisements in particular were deemed to be moving and one even won an Emmy. Nike continues to support the Black Lives Matter movement today. Nike also runs sweatshops which have previously come under fire for their treatment of workers in terms of workers' safety, minimum wage and long, exhausting hours.",That we regret the 'model minority' aspiration for individuals in diasporas in the West.
5,Quarterfinals,"Recently, Xi Jinping has taken several policy decisions aimed at curbing China's consumer tech giants (like Tencent and Alibaba), by bifurcating tech into what he calls """"need to have"""" technologies (comprising infrastructure and raw materials) and """"nice to have"""" technologies (consumer tech, like social media, e-commerce companies, etc). This comes in the wake of a global semiconductor shortage, which exposed global reliance on American chip-manufacturers.","That, as the Chinese government, we would prioritise technological raw materials & infrastructure over consumer technology."
6,Semifinals,"On August 30th, China announced its ""anti-addiction system"". New rules proclaimed that, in order to “effectively protect the physical and mental health of minors”, children under 18 would only be allowed to play online games between 8pm and 9pm on Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays. This system requires gamers to use their real names, and a government-issued identity number, to play online, and kicks them from the game when their allotted time has expired.",That we support China's anti-addiction system.
7,Grand Final,"1. The Parmenides principle says that there is a single unchanging reality (being), even if our understanding of it keeps varying over time. It is popularly summarised as “whatever is, is, and what isn’t, cannot be.”
Followers try to understand “what is”, by investigating into unchanging objects, and discussing how they can be known through reason.
2. The opposite position is Skepticism, which refutes the possibility of developing “knowledge” of any objective reality. It states that there are varying degrees of plausibility, on the basis of which we form beliefs to live our lives by, and having beliefs is the best that we can ever do.",That we prefer a world in which most people believe in the Parmenides principle rather than skepticism.
8,Novice Finals,,That we would promote narratives of collective guilt over individual guilt after large scale crimes against humanity.
