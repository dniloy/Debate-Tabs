1,Round 2,"There are efforts directed at scientific development of artificial womb technology, using which we could gradually move towards a system where gametes of the couple would be collected for a child to be carried to term in an artifical womb. This can address the most intractable imbalance between the sexes in terms of division of labour during the gestation period endured by a woman.
Currently, Apple, Google and other major companies offer to freeze the eggs of their employees for free, so as to not let pregnancy affect their most productive years.",TH as a feminist movement would support scientific research towards artificial womb technology
2,Round 3,"The “BJMool” phrase is one that has been heavily used by the Left to criticise the TMC and BJP in the Bengal Elections, suggesting that a vote for TMC is like a vote for BJP and that they are simply parties that are serving each other’s interests. This has come in the wake of major transfers to the BJP side from the old guard of the TMC, along with allegations of money exchange between the two, corruption pardons for TMC  in exchange for political sway for the BJP and for turning a blind eye to the activities of the BJP at the centre.
On the other hand, a large section of Bengal voters, who in spite of being vocal about the TMC’s failures, believe it to be the “lesser evil”, on the excuse that it is atleast not communal or hindutva. This section suggests that a vote to anybody apart from the TMC is a mistake, if the BJP is to be kept AWAY, REGARDLESS of whether you are a TMC supporter or not. This faction has also declined to take the Left into account, claiming that there is no “viable” alternative between BJP and TMC (even though the left front, along with congress and ISF exists).
In multi-party democracies, a candidate is expected to cast their vote for the candidate and party they believe in the most and one which aligns with their personal interests.",THB that the “lesser evil” narratives to gain votes is an un-democratic narrative.
