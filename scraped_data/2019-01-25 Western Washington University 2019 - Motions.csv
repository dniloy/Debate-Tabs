Hostile architecture is a subset of attempts to ”design out crime” and ""anti-social behavior"". Also known as defensive architecture, hostile design, unpleasant design, exclusionary design, or defensive urban design, it is most typically associated with ""anti-homeless spikes"" — studs embedded in flat surfaces to make sleeping rough, uncomfortable, and impractical. Other measures include sloped window sills to stop people sitting, benches with armrests positioned to stop people lying on them, and water sprinklers that ""intermittently come on but aren't really watering anything.” Hostile architecture also seeks to deter skateboarding, littering, loitering, and public urination.",RD4 THR the increasing prevalence of hostile architecture.

6,Grand Final,"War Powers
Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war. The President, meanwhile, derives the power to direct the military after a Congressional declaration of war from Article II, Section 2, which names the President Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces. These provisions require cooperation between the President and Congress regarding military affairs, with Congress funding or declaring the operation and the President directing it. Nevertheless, throughout the 20th and 21stcenturies, Presidents have often engaged in military operations without express Congressional consent. These operations include the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Operation Desert Storm, the Afghanistan War of 2001 and the Iraq War of 2002.","TH, the US Congress, should enforce the war powers act by limiting the ability of the executive branch to independently use military force against or within the boundaries of sovereign nations, except when authorized by Congress."
