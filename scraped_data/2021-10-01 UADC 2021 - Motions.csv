13,EFL Quarterfinals,"Blaxploitation movies refer to groups of films that feature black actors in lead roles and center around African diasporas overcoming oppressive, antagonistic and generally white authority figures aided by lackeys selling out the community for their personal gain. The term ""blaxploitation"" was coined by parts of the community in the early 70s as criticism for the images of African Americans depicted in the genre, and the typically white filmmakers at the helm of production. Prominent films of this genre range from ""Watermelon Man"" and ""Blacula"" from the 1970s to more recent films like ""Django Unchained"" and ""BlacKkKlansman"" from the 2000s which involve messages of empowerment. The genre became less popular in the 80s after it received criticisms for its ""unpolished nature"" and controversial themes heavily involving drugs and violence but has since then made a more popular comeback.",This house believes that contemporary black film makers should actively create films which embrace blaxploitation (Blaxploitation)
