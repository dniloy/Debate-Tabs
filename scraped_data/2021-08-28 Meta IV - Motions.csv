0,Round 1,,THW rather be a strong debater at a weak school than a weak debater at a strong school. (Gainz)
1,Round 2,"Within BP debating any fact claim cannot be instantly credited if simply asserted. Rather the judges act as ""average informed voters."" This means you must prove fact claims via structural reasons for it to be credited. For example, according to this a judge shouldn't credit the assertion ""China is about to have a pension crisis"" rather teams would have to say ""China is about to have a pension problem because of an ageing population because of the one child policy leading to low birth rates over the past decades.",THBT spec knowledge which is true and accurate should be instantly credited within debates. (Speccy)
2,Round 3,"A virtual assistant adjudicator (VAA), would be an adjudicator who would have access to a recording of a debate which they could view during the deliberation in order to verify tracking, or replay a specific small clip of the debate for the panel. The VAA would not have a vote in adjudication and would delete the recording immediately after the deliberation.",TH welcomes the introduction of VAA's. (Robot)
3,Round 4,,THBT competitive debating does more to uphold status quo than work to change it. (Delta)
4,Grand Final,"For the purposes of this debate, you are in your last year of WUDC, but, you are tired and sick of debating. There is nothing you hate more on this ungodly plain than hearing the words ""delta,"" ""comparative"" and ""deadlock."" You are still a good debater though and have managed to make the final, and as much as it pains you, you have an equal chance at winning.","TH, as a debater in their last year of WUDC, who has made the open final, would throw the final (this could include but is not limited to, running a meme case, shitting on stage, downing a can, going ad hom against someone you dislike, singing the entirety of bohemian rhapsody etc.) (wudc)"
