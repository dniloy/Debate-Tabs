2,Round 3,"In post-independence decades, Dalit leaders in the Indian National Congress and the Janata Party got to share power as representatives of a particular caste. Prominent Dalit leaders such as Bhola Paswan Shastri, Ram Sundar Das and Damodaram Sanjivayya rose from the grassroots to become chief ministers of states such as Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, while Babu Jagjivan Ram was sworn in as Indiaâ€™s only ever Dalit Deputy Prime Minister in India. All of these leaders belonged to mainstream national political parties.
In the 1980s, Dalit leaders began choosing to establish their own independent caste-based political parties, such as the founding of the Bahujan Samajwadi Party by Kanshi Ram in 1984. This trend has continued into the 21st century, with Dalit leaders who were previously part of mainstream parties also opting to break away and float their own splinter groups. For example, Ram Vilas Paswan, a leading former figure of the Janata Party, formed his own Lok Janshakti Party in 2000. Similarly, Jitan Ram Manjhi split from the Janata Dal (United) to form the Hindustani Awam Morcha in 2015.",THBT Dalit Leaders should work within existing mainstream political parties rather than forming their own independent parties
