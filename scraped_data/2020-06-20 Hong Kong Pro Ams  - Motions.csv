This economic conflict resulted in a sheer drop of oil price over the spring of 2020. Russia walked out of the agreement, leading to the fall of the OPEC+ alliance and rapid increase in oil production in OPEC countries, particularly Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is also considered the de facto leader of OPEC and the organization tends to follow their lead. Russia have since then agreed to a production cut which extension can only be bilaterally negotiated.","TH, as Russia, would pursue an oil war against Saudi Arabia"
