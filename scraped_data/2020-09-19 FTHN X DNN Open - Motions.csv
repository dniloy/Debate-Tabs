Hari stages an armed robbery in a nearby bank and gets sent to the same jail as Madan. In that crime, no money was taken and nobody was harmed.

Hari believes that his brother is innocent and thus he staged that armed robbery to break his brother out of prison. Hari attempts a Prison break and manages to rescue Madan, but he inevitably also has to take another inmate, Ram out of the jail with them or risk discovery.

Ram is a Notorious criminal and while on the run he commits two murders. After 10 days on the run, new conclusive evidence comes to light, and Madan is proven innocent.
