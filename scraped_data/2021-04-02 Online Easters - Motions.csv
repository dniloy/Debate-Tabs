0,Open Finals,"""For the purposes of this debate, a 'kakistocratic court' is a court that determines whether politicians are fit to govern. These courts would operate similarly to, but outside of, existing legal systems.
They would only have the power to strip individuals of the right to hold or run for office. They would not be able to issue any other punishments.
These courts would not make judgments about an individual's character or competency, but rather would assess on the balance of probabilities whether individuals had committed acts that would disqualify them from the ability to govern. The list of these acts might include currently criminalised behaviour but could also include other acts that are not currently criminalised.",That we support the introduction of kakistocratic courts in Western Liberal Democracies.

The Australian Greens recently announced their ""hung parliament strategy"" for the next federal election. The main parts of this strategy include:  a) Advocating to voters the benefits of a hung parliament and how it could be likely to oust the Liberal & National Parties from powerb) aggressively targetting 9 Lower House seats (5 Labor-held and 4 Liberal-held) in order to gain the balance of power in the Lower House and force a hung parliament c) Targetting Labor voters and trying to force the Labor party into minority government with the Greens so they can exert influence on policy",That progressives in Australia should not support the Greens' hung parliament strategy
