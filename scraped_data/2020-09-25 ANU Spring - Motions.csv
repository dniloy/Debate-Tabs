2,Round 2,"After the collapse of communism in Europe, many countries implemented a policy of lustration. The policy involves screening new officials (elected or appointed) and sets some consequences if they are found to have been involved with the communist regime (in particular, collaborated with the secret services). These consequences can range from publicising information about collaboration in the previous regime through dismissal and banning from holding certain offices. Notably, this policy captured large proportions of the population by including informants, members of the secret police and those in government positions during the regime.",This House regrets the policy of lustration implemented in post-Communist nations in Europe.
3,Round 3,"For the purpose of this debate, the political executive will first make a decision to initiate war.

7,Semifinals,"The African Monetary Union (AMU) is the proposed creation of an economic and monetary union for the countries of the African Union, administered by the African Central Bank.

8,ESL Grand Final,There are two broad ways of describing personal identity: relational and atomised. The relational self is understood as it relates to others. The nature of an individual is determined by how that individual stands in relation to others. The atomised self is one where personal identity is described as discrete and self-contained. An atomised self may interact and cooperate with others but each is a separate unit entire unto itself.,This House would prefer if personal identity was conceptualised as relational instead of atomised.
