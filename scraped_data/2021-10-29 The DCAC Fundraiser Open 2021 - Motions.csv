0,Round 1,"Context-1: In the past, the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) had explicitly articulated a sense of pan-Tamil, trans-national consciousness, which would allow Sri Lankan Tamilians to lay claim to a culture which was seemingly being hegemonised by their Indian and other non-Sri Lankan counterparts. The symbols used to represent their struggle were explicitly derived from a semi-mythologised “golden age” of Tamil civilisation (Sangam era) and significant attempts were made at emphasising a notion of transnational solidarity. After the defeat of the LTTE in 2009, the leaders of the Tamil political alliances of Sri Lanka have actively limited their demands for an independent nation state. Instead, alliances like the TNA (Tamil National Alliance) and TNPF (Tamil National People’s Front) have rallied with the intention of securing greater levels of autonomy by supporting a federal structure that accommodates their demand for “regional self-rule"""". The leaders of the political alliances have also limited their expression of trans-national solidarity, fearing that doing so would further legitimise the claims of the majoritarian Sinhala nationalists, who sought to characterise them as outsiders without a legitimate claim in Sri Lanka. Instead, they have decided to assert their distinctiveness as a community with a historic Tamil presence and heritage within Sri Lanka itself.
Context-2: On several occasions, the Sri Lankan government has arrested various members of the political alliances for actively memorialising historic Sri Lankan Tamil activists like Lt. Col. Thileepan.  The government has also limited any attempts at commemorating the Tamilians who had lost their lives at the hands of the Sri Lankan government during their struggle with the LTTE. Such acts of repression by the Sri Lankan government have significantly hampered the ability of Tamil leaders and activists at emphasising their distinctive sense of self as a community within the nation. While many believe that the claim to a trans-national, pan-Tamil identity allows for a greater visibility of the Sri Lankan Tamil cause by encouraging international expressions of solidarity, others believe that this approach would allow several non-Sri Lankan Tamils to misunderstand, dilute and appropriate their struggle within the Nation. As of today, Palermo City, Italy has recognised the “genocide of Eelam Tamils perpetrated by the Sri Lankan state” and a few months ago, the British foreign secretary had expressed his desire to secure a level of funding that would allow a thorough investigation of the war crimes in Sri Lanka.""","THO the decision of the Tamil Political Alliances in Sri Lanka to limit the expression of a a Trans-national, pan Tamil consciousness (Politics)"
1,Round 2,"Babasaheb Ambedkar had made a historic declaration on October 13, 1935 at Yeola (in Nashik district) of his resolve to renounce Hinduism. As a follow-up of this declaration and in order to have a blueprint for the tasks ahead, a conference titled Mumbai Ilakha Mahar Parishad (Mumbai Province Mahar Conference) was organised from May 30 to June 1, 1936 at Mumbai. In the conference, Ambedkar made a detailed and passionate speech, which was published under the title “Mukti Kon Pathe?” (“Which Path to Salvation?”).In “Mukti Kon Pathe?” Ambedkar outlined two considerations in changing religion – existential and spiritual. In explaining the existential consideration, he mainly indicated the pitiful plight of Dalits. They suffered atrocities at the feeblest violation of the caste code as perceived by the caste Hindus. Coming to the existential aspect of this problem, he observed that the lack of strength of Dalits was the root cause of the perpetuation of this conflict. Dalits did not possess any of the three strengths human beings are expected to possess, namely, the strengths of numbers, wealth and education. If Dalits relied upon their own strength, they could not hope to escape their prevailing miserable state. He thus justifies his call for conversion as an existential necessity for Dalits. It followed that the religion they convert to should have a sizeable community in the country, with Islam, Christianity and Sikhism implicitly constituting his zone of consideration.The spiritual consideration in the change of religion was related with enhancing the worth of an individual. Since the Hindu religion did not have any place for an individual, it could not provide spiritual solace to anyone. According to Ambedkar, the real objective of a religion should be the spiritual development of individuals: “[B]irth of an individual is not for service of the society, it is for his or her own emancipation.” He saw the necessity of three things for the development of an individual – compassion, equality and freedom, which he saw in Buddhism.",THW prefer existential utility over spiritual utility while picking a new religion (Caste)
2,Round 3,"""Ain't I a Woman?"" is a speech, delivered extemporaneously, by Sojourner Truth, (1797–1883), born into slavery in New York State. Sometime after gaining her freedom in 1827, she became a well-known anti-slavery speaker. Her speech was delivered at the Women's Convention in Akron, Ohio, on May 29, 1851. If there is a canon of African-American women’s rhetoric, Sojourner Truth’s speech “Ain’t I a Woman?” is a central text in that collection. It was an aptly chosen name, as illustrated by her speech, in which she at once refutes the prevailing myth that women are weaker than men while challenging social definitions of womanhood—which relies upon ideas about white women’s femininity and purity. Most people are familiar with the 1863 popular version of Sojourner Truth's famous, “Ain’t I a woman” speech but they have no idea that this popular version, while based off of Sojourner’s original 1851 speech, is not Sojourner's speech and is vastly different from Sojourner’s original 1851 speech. This popular but inaccurate version was written and published in 1863, (12 years after Sojourner gave the ""Ain't I a woman"" speech), by a white abolitionist named Frances Dana Barker Gage. Curiously, Gage chose to represent Sojourner speaking in a stereotypical 'southern black slave accent', rather than in Sojourner’s distinct upper New York State low-Dutch accent. In an issue of the Kalamazoo Daily Telegraph, an article states that Truth prided herself on “fairly correct English, which is in all senses a foreign tongue to her. . . . People who report her often exaggerate her expressions, putting in to her mouth the most marked southern dialect.”
For comparison, this is an excerpt from the text:  “That man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere. Nobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud-puddles, or gives me any best place! And ain’t I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm! I have ploughed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me!”
Gage’s version: “Dat man ober dar say dat women needs to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have de best place eberywhar. Nobody eber helps me into carriages or ober mud-puddles, or gives me any best place. - And ar’n’t I a woman? Look at me. Look at my arm.

4,Round 5,"The Met Gala is an annual event organised by Vogue to raise funds for the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It was started in 1948 and is widely considered to be one of the most luxurious, extravagant and exclusive events in the world. This year, the value of a ticket for the event was $35,000 and while some invited attendees don’t have to pay for this ticket, many believe that the cost of attending this event reflects an unnecessary extravagance. While the event is often viewed as a reflection of fashionable high culture, many attendees decided to show up wearing clothes that defy existing ideas surrounding what is and isn’t “fashionable”. From Alexandria Ocasio Cortez to Cara Delevingne and Carolyn B. Maloney, several politicians and celebrities decided to wear clothes that explicitly seek to make a progressive socio-political statement. According to Judith Thurman, this year’s Met Gala raises questions about the position of “protest fashion” in contemporary society. She argues that women throughout history have used fashion as a means of expressing their resistance to oppressive institutions and frameworks.
However, several individuals have pointed out that the attempt to take progressive politics inside an event like the Met Gala has ultimately added to the event’s legitimacy. Furthermore, while the event was going on, several Black Lives Matter protestors were being arrested for calling out the police for its unwillingness to protect marginalized communities. Given the nature of these events, several activists have questioned the validity of carrying progressive political statements into spaces that are potentially repeating the very cycle of oppression that the protestors outside the event are fighting against.",THS the politicization of Met Gala (Mixed Bag)
5,Open Quarterfinals,"The Stampede Trail is a route made famous by Christopher McCandless, who walked it in April 1992. Many people now know about McCandless and how the 24-year-old idealist bailed out of his middle-class suburban life, donated his $24,000 in savings to charity, and embarked on a two-year hitchhiking odyssey that led him to Alaska and the deserted Fairbanks City Transit bus number 142, which still sits, busted and rusting, 20 miles down the Stampede Trail. For 67 days, he ate mostly squirrel, ptarmigan, and porcupine. After a few months, a moose hunter found McCandless’s decomposed body in a sleeping bag inside the bus, where he had starved to death.
This tragic story was told by Jon Krakauer in the January 1993 issue of Outside and later in his bestselling 1997 book, Into the Wild. The book, and a 2007 film directed by Sean Penn, helped elevate the McCandless saga to the status of modern myth. And that, in turn, has given rise to a unique and curious phenomenon in Alaska: McCandless pilgrims, inspired by his story, who are determined to see the bus for themselves. ""The Magic Bus"" has become a pilgrimage destination for trekkers who camp at the vehicle, some of whom have gotten into their own difficulties or even died due to the Teklanika River. They camp at the bus for days, sometimes weeks, write essays in the various logbooks stowed inside, and ponder the impact that McCandless’s anti-materialist ethic, free-spirited travels, and time in the Alaskan wild has had on how they perceive the world.
From almost the moment he was found, the meaning of Chris McCandless's life and lonely death has been fiercely argued. The debate falls into two camps: Krakauer's visionary seeker; a romantic figure inspired by what they see as his free-spirited idealism; or, as many Alaskans see it, an unprepared person who had fundamentally misjudged the wilderness he'd wanted so desperately to commune with.",THR the glorification of Christopher McCandless’s legacy (Art and Literature)

7,Open Semifinals,"There’s growing recognition in the field of psychology that people are experiencing distress over climate change. More than 40% of Americans felt “disgusted” or “helpless” about climate change, according to a survey published by researchers at Yale University. A 2020 poll from the APA found that more than half of respondents were somewhat or extremely anxious about the effects of climate change on their own mental health. Though not officially classified in the DSM-5, the term therapists use to classify and treat mental illnesses, there’s a name for this state of despair that has emerged from academic texts and media since as recently as 2007: eco-anxiety.
In some ways, climate change anxiety is a rational response, said Leslie Davenport, a therapist based in Tacoma, Washington. “Eco-anxiety is a natural response to a threat. And this is a very real threat,” Davenport said. Yet it can also debilitate. In college, I began a campaign to shut down fracking in Los Angeles County. Within months, I burned out. Constantly contemplating the impact of fracking on our atmosphere and communities was making it difficult for me to function at a basic level.
Because of this tension between eco-anxiety’s role as a rational but potentially debilitating response, there’s no clear, standard definition as to when eco-anxiety is unhealthy, if it ever is. “That’s one of the questions we really need to be asking,” Clayton said. “Anxiety is not pleasant to experience, but it’s not necessarily a bad thing. It’s an emotional signal that we need to be paying attention.
Definition: Medicalization is the process of labelling ‘eco-anxiety’ as an illness requiring formal diagnosis of symptoms, and prescribed treatment through biochemical, psychiatric, or intervention by formal medical apparatuses such as admittance in a hospital.",THS the medicalization of eco-anxiety (Climate Change)

9,Open Grand Final,"The late Hubert Dreyfus and Sean Kelly‘s book, All Things Shining: Reading the Western Classics to Find Meaning in a Secular Age, addresses the question of finding meaning in the contemporary world. The preface sets out the book’s project:The world doesn’t matter to us the way it used to. The intense and meaningful lives of Homer’s Greeks, and the grand hierarchy of meaning that structured Dante’s medieval Christian world, both stand in stark contrast to our secular age. The world used to be, in its various forms, a world of sacred, shining things. The shining things now seem far away.[3:48 PM]The first chapter, entitled “Our Contemporary Nihilism,” focuses on the angst caused by the many choices we now have compared to previous generations. In response people typically adopt a self-confident persona to mask their insecurity, or they become paralyzed by their obsessions and addictions. But neither mollifies our existential anguish, as anxiety pervades western civilization, as our former religious moorings have been lost. In the Middle Ages, for better or worse, nearly everyone believed that God created them and determined their fate. One could choose to turn away from God and sin in medieval times, but being an atheist or rejecting religious ethics altogether wasn’t an available choice. But today ethical prescriptions are tenuous, and nihilism is a viable option. The faith that once comforted does so no longer—today even fervent believers face existential questions. But Dreyfus and Kelly present us with a third option: the ability to find your own sacred meaning in the everyday— the ritual of drinking your daily cup of coffee, the music that puts you in a trance of pure bliss, or the sacred attachment you have with a sports team. They describe this as a practice of neo-polytheism, where we imbue sacred meaning in the flow of our daily lives. One where our desires, and fancies come to define our own personal God. Yet this everyday is often informed by the vices of capitalist consumption, of falling into the trap of advertisement and vanity. By finding meaning in your own individual niche, one also risks erasing the embedded moral conflicts, and inequalities that accompany the expensive world of coffee and sports. And they also hold the risk of losing touch with community, and the collective force of sharing religious experience in an institutionalized setting.",THP atheism over neo-polytheism (Philosophy)
