3,Round 4,"Pedagogy can be understood as the method and practice of teaching or delivering content to learners. Pedagogy includes two branches: Cognitivism and Constructivism. Cognitivism places students as empty vessels to be filled by teachers, and knowledge is arranged in a manner that is organised and easy to comprehend for students.There is an emphasis on structuring information to facilitate mental processing for example, student group work, organising knowledge through presentations, demonstrations, and illustrative examples.  On the other hand, in a constructivist classroom, both teacher and students think of knowledge as a dynamic view of the world we live in. Students build personal interpretations of the world based on individual experiences and interactions, along with teachers as a part of the activity. Thus, knowledge is constantly open to change; there is not an objective reality that students strive to know. In order to understand the learning which has taken place within an individual, the actual experience must be examined by the student.","Assuming feasibility, THP constructivist pedagogy over cognitivist pedagogy in university/college education (education)"
