An example of Afro-futurist literature is Wakanda (Marvel) and Beyonce's Lemonade (2016).Alternatively, Afro-pessimism is a lens of interpretation that accounts for, and focuses on the ongoing effects of racism, colonialism, and historical processes of enslavement including the trans-Atlantic slave trade and their impact on structural conditions as well as the personal, subjective, and lived experience and embodied reality of African Americans.
